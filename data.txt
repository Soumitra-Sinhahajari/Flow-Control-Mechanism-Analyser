I am, for sure fortunate to have my school companion, Kajal as my best friend even at this point. It started on the second day of my U.K.G class. I earned the closest companion of my life when I was only five years of age. I do accept that she is the best thing at any point in my life. She is still there as inspiration.

We played together, giggled together, cried together, grew up together, gained experiences together. Lastly, when fourteen years of school life came to an end, we said farewell and separated our ways.

Even though miles separated, we either call or send messages every day. We are connected by heart and gives time to each other. We talk about the occasions in our lives and cherish every minute together, think back to our past times, and miss each other.

Life proceeds with its fantastic journey, such a large number of close companions came all through my life, yet none substituted the sole position saved for my best friend, who remained close by during the back and forth movement of my little life.
